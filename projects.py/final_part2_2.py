#os
# gives access to operating system features
# useful for clearing the screen (os.system("cls")) or managing save files

#sys
# gives control over the Python system itself
# helpful for exiting the game (sys.exit()) or reading command-line arguments

#json
# lets you save and load player data in easy-to-read files
# perfect for inventory, stats, quests, settings, or save files
